# BouncinBalls\
Overview
This project is a web-based simulation of bouncing balls using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It creates multiple colorful balls that move around the screen, bouncing off the edges of the browser window.

Features
Dynamic Ball Creation: Automatically generates 10 balls with random positions, velocities, and colors.
Bouncing Logic: Balls bounce off the edges of the browser window, providing an engaging visual effect.
Responsive: Adjusts ball movement based on the window size.
Prerequisites
A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) to run the HTML file.
How to Use
Clone the Repository: Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the HTML File: Open index.html (or whatever you've named it) in a web browser.
Watch the Balls: The balls will be created automatically and will start moving as soon as the page loads.
Code Structure
HTML: Basic structure to include a script for functionality.
CSS: Simple styling to remove margins and prevent overflow, allowing for full-screen interaction.
JavaScript:
Ball Creation: The create() function generates balls with random properties.
Movement: The move() function updates the position of each ball and handles the bouncing logic.
Random Functions: Various utility functions to generate random positions, colors, and velocities.
Functionality
The balls are created as div elements with a circular shape.
The random positions and velocities give each ball a unique movement pattern.
The balls bounce off the edges of the window using simple collision detection.
